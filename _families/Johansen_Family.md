It is not known when he arrived in Alaska but by 1895 he was living on Kodiak Island and married to **Alexandra Chichenoff** when his first son **John Victor Johansen** was born.  

In 1900 Anton and Alexandra and four children were living in Karluk, where he was farming. In 1906 he had a saloon in Afognak where he offered trade tokens.

In 1910 he was living in Seldovia where he owned and managed a general store, **Seldovia Mercantile Company**. The store was originally a general store and later was just for cigars and billiards. Aluminum 10 cent and 12 cent trade tokens were offered in the store.
