**HENRY RICHARD BOWEN**, son of David [Bowen](../_families/Bowen_Family.md), was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts in
1853. He came to Alaska as a sea captain in the late 1800s and brought a load of salt and barrels for the canneries in Kodiak.  It was said that he was paid in shares in the Alaska Commercial Company.  In 1880 a salting station of the Western Fur and Trading Company of San Francisco, operated at Karluk with Captain Bowen of Saint Paul (Kodiak) as the local superintendent. They also maintained a saltery at Kasilof. 

At one time he was in charge of all the Northern Commercial
Company stores from Yakatat to Dutch Harbor. *Bowen believed that the
opportunities for fishing on Kodiak Island were exceptional. He told a
government official that "fishermen with a limited amount of capital can
establish themselves most readily in a lucrative business on Kodiak
Island…". Bowen returned to Gloucester several times after moving to
Alaska, but no amount of persuasion on his part could induce any of the
New England fishermen to move to Alaska. He married Vavara (Barbara)
Annie NAUMOFF in Kodiak and had 9 children.  Mrs. Bowen was "the
Russian woman who showed Mother how to make those wonderful fish pies
the Russians called"perog", and the Bowens were anxious for the
schoolroom in St. Paul to be finished so they too could send their
children to school" *From Humboldt to Kodiak* by Fred Roscoe, 1992*

Henry met Barbara NAUMOFF Smith in Kodiak; she had been married to William C. Smith and had two children Julian and Ann. After Smith died, Julian and Ann went to live with their relatives in California.

As captain of the fur-trading schooner *Pauline Collins*, he escaped from the ship when it broke on the rocks in 1881, but drowned 14 years later when the ill-fated *Seventy-Six* disappeared with all hands between Kodiak and Kayak Island.

The 38 ton 60 foot schooner *Seventy-Six* departed Woody Island
December 11, 1895 with six crewmen and one passenger aboard. It was
bound for Kayak Island, continuing on to Prince William Sound on a
trading voyage. The vessel disappeared with all hands. The
*Seventy-Six* was owned by the North American Commercial Company
whose principal station was at Woody Island. Weather was fair when the
vessel departed the island but deteriorated into a terrific northerly
gale soon after. Friends of the *Seventy-Six* crew reported their
concern that the vessel had no extra sails and that those they were
using were not in good condition and may not be able to withstand a
storm. Lost with the *Seventy-Six* were Captain Henry R. Bowen (45)
of Massachusetts and North American Commercial Company’s foreman who was
in charge of the expedition, and six others. Captain Bowen left behind a
wife and 9 children. The steamer Dora reported that wreckage from the
schooner drifted ashore near Kodiak Island. **The rest of the Bowen
family lived in Kodiak until Mt. Katmai erupted in 1912.**
