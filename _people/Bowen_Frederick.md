**Frederick Bowen** was born 3 October 1891 in Kodiak, Alaska to [**Captain Henry Richard Bowen**](./Bowen_Captain_Henry_Richard.md) and his wife [**Barbara Naumann**](./Naumann_Barbara.md) 

The family moved to Wood Island in 1893. When Mount Katmai erupted, many of the people of Wood Island and Kodiak, including the Bowen family, moved to Seldovia. 

He married Anna McCrae who was born in Sunrise, Alaska. Anna had been born with a crippled back and Bill Rohde and Barbara had taken care of her. She had tuberculosis and died 29 April 1933 in Seward, Alaska.

Children of Frederick and Anna are:
•	Rufas Phillip, born 16 September 1920, Seldovia; died 12 October 1993.
•	Isam C., born 1922, Seldovia.
•	[**Robert L. "Bulla"**](./Bowen_Robert_Bulla.md), born 1925, Seldovia; died 31 August 1961, Seldovia.
•	Norman Henry (Barney), born 3 July 1926, Seldovia.
•	Barbara Marie, born 8 April 1929, Seldovia; died 11 December 2018, Vancouver, Washington.

—Seldovia, about 1931
Fred Bowen, who has been employed for some months on Clyde Coombs’ Pearl Island fox farm, came to town last Wednesday and visited with his family for a couple of days. When he went back to the island Friday morning, he took along two of his young sons, Isam and Robert, their chief jobs to be to keep the “old-man” from getting lonesome.

The blues run wild, Mr. Bowen explained, but there are enough signs to assure that the season will be a profitable one.
