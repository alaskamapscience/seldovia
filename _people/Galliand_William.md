Lifelong Alaska resident **WILLIAM "Wild Bill" GALLIAND** passed away on May 21, 2022, with his wife **Clara Moonin**, as always, fittingly at his side. 

Wild Bill was born Nov. 14, 1957, to the late Wilda Me Farley and William Galliand Sr. in St. Louis, Missouri. He grew up in Sacramento, California, and moved to Seldovia in the early 1970s. Bill worked as a commercial fisherman from seining, crab and salmon fishing, to long lining and set netting. His last season set netting was in 2019.

William Galliand will be missed by his immediate and extended family, along with the Seldovia community and the fishing industry brotherhood he worked in throughout his lifetime. He adopted most of his wifeâ€™s traditional Sugpiaq lifestyle and enjoyed living off the land and sea.
