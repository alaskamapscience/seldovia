**FREDERICK WALTER NEWMEYER, "FREDDY** was a leap year baby, born February 29, 1928 in San Francisco,
California, the only child weighing in at 13 pounds in his day. His parents were Emma and Fredrick Walter Newmeyer. Fred, his father, was born in Basel, Switzerland and his mother in Neustettin, Germany.  Fred, Senior must have been a baker in the Old Country, because he was already working as a baker in Austin Texas not long after he arrived in the US in 1923. After he and Emma married they opened their own bakery on Polk Street in San Francisco.

The bakery, located at 1338 Polk Street, is especially attractive and is kept modern in every detail. Mr. Newmeyer is well known as a baker and has a reputation for the superior quality of ingredients used in the production of his fine >cakes.
