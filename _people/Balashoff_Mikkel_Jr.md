Seldovia Frontiersman: May 10 1947 
Man Loses Eye in Knife Battle
*Stabbed in the left eye during a quarrel in the early morning hours Friday, Mike Balashof stumbled to Seldovia Hospital unaided in search of medical assistance. He later underwent major surgery at the hospital for removal of the injured eye. Mr. Balashof was unable to give a coherent account of the events which led to his injury.  He said he had been fighting but the name of his assailant was not given.  Dr. Melvin Beltz said he had been unable to learn any details. He described the wound as a long gash which bared the entire eye.*


Mike is buried in the Seldovia City Cemetery in Plot #578.
