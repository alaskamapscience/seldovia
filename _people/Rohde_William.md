**William Bill Rohde** was born in Germany in 1859. 

In 1892 William Rohde gave testimony on fur seals in Alaska.  He said he was master hunter and owner of a trading schooner and lived at St Paul Harbor, Kodiak.  He had been in Alaska 6 years 

He married, before 1900, [**Paraskovia Dobrovolsky**](./Rohde_Paraskovia.md), the daughter of [**Father Peter Dobrovolsky**](Dobrovolsky_Father_Peter.md). They lived in Kodiak in 1900 and in Seldovia in 1910. Their sons, John and Nicholas, were listed as adopted so they may have been children of Paraskovia and a previous husband. Paraskovia died in 1911 and Bill later married **Varvara Barbara Anna Naumoff**.

Bill and Paraskovia as well as her father all died in Seldovia.  He is buried in the Seldovia Hillside Cemetery and his wife and her father are buried in the Russian Orthodox section of the Seldovia City Cemetery that was moved there in 1967 from the lower area of town.
